# Job-Change-Prediction-Using-Data-Visualization-Python-Jupyter-Notebook-
This project analyzes a job-seeker dataset to understand what factors influence a person's decision to change their job.

#  Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of job seekers to identify why people switch jobs.
Using Python and data visualization techniques, we uncover patterns such as:
*Experience level
*Education background
*Training hours
*Company size
The goal is to support data-driven decision making for HR teams and recruitment platforms.

#  Objectives
*Visualize employment trends and job change behavior.
*Understand what factors influence an employee’s decision to switch jobs.
*Derive insights that can help recruiters improve hiring & retention strategies.

Most candidates in the dataset are actively looking for a job change.
 2. Experience vs Job Change
Candidates with 0–2 years of experience are more likely to change jobs.
 Insight: Freshers and early-career professionals switch frequently to grow skill and salary.
 3. Training Hours
Job changers have higher training hours compared to those who are stable.
 Insight: People invest time in learning before switching to improve opportunities.
 4. Company Size
Employees from small companies show higher job-switch intention.
 Insight: Stability and growth opportunities may be higher in large companies.
